IO4 Output adapter driver for a 2-head signal mast

Takes an IO4-Output and drives 2x 3-LED common Anode signal heads using a demultiplexor logic chip.

Designed in conjunction with Jay Beckham for his South Shore Lines layout

Circuit info:
  * The board is driven from an IO4 port that carries +5, GND and 4x output signals.
  * Signal heads / LEDs are "common anode" - pin4 of the signal head connector is VCC, the "colors" pins are driven LOW to energize the LED.
  * The board can drive 2x signal heads, each with R, Y, G and DARK aspects
      * Control signals 1 & 2 and  3 & 4, each control one head:
          : 00 - Green
          : 01 - Yellow
          : 10 - Red
          : 11 - Dark
  * This board does not have provision for adjustable LED brightness.  The resistors are fixed at production time for high efficiency LEDS used in SPCoast's Simple Signal masts.
